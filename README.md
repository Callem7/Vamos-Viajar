## About
"Let's Travel" is a dynamic programming project that allows users to manage and share information about landmarks on a website. It is hosted on localhost port 3000 and was developed using a range of technologies, including MongoDB, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript, and Node.js, as well as various libraries and frameworks. The source code for the project is hosted on GitHub, allowing developers to collaborate on the project and track changes to the codebase.

The website includes a login and registration system to access the admin page, which has three tabs: "Articles," "Email," and "callback-requests." The main page of the website features three static slides with arrows that allow users to browse through different images and information about landmarks. These slides can be used to highlight popular or featured landmarks, or to provide an overview of the content available on the website.

The "Articles" tab in the admin page allows administrators to create, edit, and delete posts about landmarks. To create a new post, administrators can enter the name, country, image file, image URL, and description of the landmark. The maps displayed on the website use the HERE Maps API to accurately show the location of the landmarks. Once a post is submitted, it appears on the main page of the website for all users to see. Users can click on the "Details" button in a post to view more detailed information about the landmark on a separate page. This page includes the main image, date of post, description, and a map showing the location of the landmark.

The "Email" tab allows administrators to view and manage email communications with users of the website. This includes emails received through a "Contact Us" form, which contains fields for the user's name, email address, and message.

The "callback-requests" tab allows administrators to view and manage requests from users for callback. These requests are submitted through a "Call me" button, which allows users to enter their phone number and request a call from the website administrators. This may be used to request more information about a particular landmark or for assistance with travel arrangements.

The "Let's Travel" programming project is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring that it is easily accessible on a wide range of devices. The MongoDB database used by the project is connected to Mongo Atlas, a cloud-based database service that allows developers to easily store and manage data in the cloud. Passwords for the login system are encrypted and stored securely in the database to protect user privacy.

Overall, the "Let's Travel" programming project provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for managing and sharing information about landmarks. Its dynamic website and admin page features make it easy for administrators to maintain and update the content on the site, and the login and registration
